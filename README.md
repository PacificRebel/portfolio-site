This is a test-driven, React-native web app which calls the GitHub API to link to my pages.

### Make one yourself!
It was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to add Flexbox:
`yarn add simple-flexbox`
- then add `import { Column, Row } from 'simple-flexbox';` to App.js

To open the app in a browser:
#### `yarn start`
URL: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

To run tests:
#### `yarn test`
